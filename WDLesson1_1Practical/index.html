    <!-- Challenge 1: Change the title of the page to Web Technologies -->
    <title>Web Technologies</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
    <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
    <h3>HTML</h3>

    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create web pages. It provides the structure for web pages by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML uses tags to tell the web browser how to display content on the page.</p>
    
    <!-- Challenge 4a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 5: Create a heading, h3 for CSS -->
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    
    <!-- Challenge 6: Create a paragraph explaining what is CSS. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used to style HTML elements. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall look of a web page. CSS can be applied directly within HTML or in external stylesheets to make the design of web pages more flexible and appealing.</p>
    
    <!-- Challenge 6a: Insert a horizontal rule, hr -->
    <hr>
    
    <!-- Challenge 7: Create a heading, h3 for JavaScript -->
    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
    
    <!-- Challenge 8: Create a paragraph explaining what is JavaScript. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that enables dynamic interactions on web pages. It allows developers to add features like form validation, interactive maps, and animations. JavaScript is a key component of modern web development alongside HTML and CSS, providing functionality beyond static content.</p>

    <!-- Challenge Bonus: Similar to the concepts above add one more web technology using a heading and paragraph. Here are some suggestions of concepts: JQuery, Bootstrap, AFrame -->
    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
    <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites. It includes predefined styles for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other UI elements. With Bootstrap, developers can create visually appealing and functional websites faster without having to start from scratch.</p>
